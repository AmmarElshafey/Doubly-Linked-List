# Doubly Linked List in C++

This is a simple and educational implementation of a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** in C++.
The project demonstrates basic operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal (forward & backward), and search.

## 📚 Features

- ✅ Insert at beginning
- ✅ Insert at end
- ✅ Insert before a specific node
- ✅ Delete a specific node
- ✅ Display list from head to tail
- ✅ Display list from tail to head
- ✅ Search if a value exists
- ✅ Destructor for memory cleanup
- ✅ Peek (get head) and Tail (get last node)

## 🧠 What is a Doubly Linked List?

A **Doubly Linked List** is a linear data structure where each node contains three parts:
- `data`: stores the value
- `next`: pointer to the next node
- `prev`: pointer to the previous node

This allows traversal in both directions: forward and backward.
